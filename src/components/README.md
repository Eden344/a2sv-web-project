# Todo List App with React and TypeScript

## Description
This is a simple Todo List application built using React and TypeScript, designed as part of Task 4 from the A2SV Web Track Project. The app allows users to manage tasks by adding, editing, deleting, and toggling their completion status. It leverages React components, hooks (e.g., `useState`), and TypeScript for type safety, following the concepts covered in the React Crash Course and Todo List Sample App video tutorials. Enhancements include a clean user interface with CSS styling, inline editing on double-click with a "Double click to edit" tooltip on hover, and hidden "Complete" and "Delete" buttons during edit mode for improved usability.

## Features
- **Add Tasks**: Enter a task in the input field and click "Add Task" to create a new task.
- **Edit Tasks**: Double-click a task to edit its text, with "Save" and "Cancel" options. A tooltip ("Double click to edit") appears on hover.
- **Delete Tasks**: Remove a task using the "Delete" button.
- **Toggle Completion**: Mark a task as complete or undo it with the "Complete"/"Undo" button.
- **User Experience**: "Complete" and "Delete" buttons are hidden during editing to reduce clutter.
